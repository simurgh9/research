# Scratch Notes

Whether or a problem is PAC learnable, we may still use,

For consistent learner, i. e., algorithms where training error can be
made zero,

```
m ≥ 1/e (ln|H| + ln(1/𝛿)
```

For inconsistent learners, i. e., algorithms where the training error
is optimised,

```
m ≥ 1/(2e²) (ln|H| + ln(1/𝛿)
```

*What is the easiest or most intuitive way to pose the knapsack
problem as an optimisation problem?*

??? What was that stuff about being realisable?

Mitchel, pg. 222

The knapsack problem is like the conjunction problem, but what will
the examples be and can we somehow use the bound to figure out how
many individuals we need?

Could find-S be used?

What is the best way forward?

If we use the Neural Networks then the hypothesis space blows up, if
we use the conjunctions like hypothesis space, then I can't think of
an algorithm.
